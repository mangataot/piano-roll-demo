# piano-roll-demo
A quick demo of web audio capability using Tone.js in the style of a DAW piano roll

This is also an npm package which can be installed with 'npm install piano-roll-demo'.
This is best installed as a global (add -g) and then launch index.html.
The example.js is calling the PianoRollDemo ES6 class in PianoRollDemo.js.
Although this has been published as a module it is only a demo and does not currently use 'module.exports' for modular build functionality.
